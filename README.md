Digital Contact Book is a GUI-based project in Python programming language, that runs in PyCharm. It is about storing information or details of each individual which displays the name of a person, gender and contact number, and Email. Adding new records, modifying them and updating, searching for contacts saved, and deleting the records are the basic functions. It will help you to learn more about file handling and functions.
 We can add new contacts by clicking on the add button and filling in the information of the new contact. We can update or edit existing contacts by selecting and clicking on the update button. Similarly, we can delete and view the contact. Using the search button, we can find people quickly. This application was created using the basic concepts of the Python programming language, such as Variables, Exceptions, Functions, libraries used tkinter, tree view, and file handling in the csv format.
The digital contact book is implemented in Python programming language that allows users to store, organize and manage large numbers of contact records efficiently. The system is designed to have functions such as adding, updating, viewing, searching and deleting contacts. The data is stored in the csv file. The tree view is used here for displaying the contact information of each individual stored in file. Tree view is the graphical visualization of a hierarchical representation of data with every item having more sub-items. The tree table widget displays the structure data in tabular format in rows and columns where rows represent items/ entities and columns represent attributes of the items.
